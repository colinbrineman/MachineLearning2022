# MachineLearning2022

For this project I was in charge of setting up the database our machine learning module would use. I utilized AWS to set up a Postgres DB hosted by AWS. I connected this DB to pgAdmin in whhich I imported the necessary table and schema. Once fully connected the DB information was passed to my teammate into the jupyter notebook environment.
