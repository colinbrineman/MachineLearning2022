I downloaded the Tableau workbook for [Louisa's visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/louisamam/viz/FinalProjectAirbnbchicago/ChicagoAirbnbneighbouhood?publish=yes) — as well as the [original Airbnb data file](https://github.com/colinbrineman/MachineLearning2022/blob/main/Chicago%20Airbnb%20data.csv) — so that I could publish the visualizations each on their own & thus better incorporate them into a responsive website, using Bootstrap. I say "original" data, by the way, because the data Louisa used is not example the same as the data which Rus ended up using to train the neural network. The differences shouldn't be very substantial, but I have requested that Rus send me the dataset which he used to develop the model, so that I can ensure the visualizations are completely accurate. I will also note that I would recommend substantial changes to visualizations, but since I don't want to step on anyone's toes, I left them as is. The only thing I changed is that the [chart displaying "Total Listings" and "Average Price"](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/colin.brineman/viz/FinalProjectAirbnbchicago_16521533276240/1_3TotalListingsAveragePrice?publish=yes) is now based on calculated rather than hardcoded values.
